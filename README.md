## MicroDi is now FlexDi
MicroDi has changed name to **[FlexDi]**.  The reason for this is that other dependency injection projects are already using the MicroDi name.

The name-change is for avoidance of confusion, as well as to break away from being a "public fork" of [BoDi], upon which this work is based.  The differences between FlexDi and BoDi are now so profound that this is fully an independent project of its own.
